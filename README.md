# Hi, I'm Kordian 👋

Starting in 2023, I’ve been building a homelab to learn Linux administration and DevOps on real infrastructure.

## What I'm working on

- Proxmox VE with Debian/Ubuntu VMs
- Docker & multi-node Docker Swarm with shared NFS storage
- Traefik as central reverse proxy with TLS automation
- Migrating services from LXC / standalone Docker into Swarm
- Automating host setup and deployments with Ansible (work in progress)
- Documenting everything as runbooks, design notes and inventory

## Repositories

- [homelab](https://github.com/kord1an/homelab) – infrastructure & documentation
